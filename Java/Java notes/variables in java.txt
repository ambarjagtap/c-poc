Fields are states of objects. eg on/off

Types of variables:

1. Instance variables / non- static fields : objects store their values in non static fields, without 'static' keyword. Defined outside any method or block.

2. class variablse / static fields : Any field/variable declared with static keyword. It tells compiler that only one copy exists of this variables. adding 'final' keyword will 
    fix the value forever. Defined inside method or any block.


PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES:

byte : 8 bit | signed | 2's complement int | -128 to 127 | save memory

short : 16 bit | signed | 2's complement int | -32,768 to 32,767 | 

int : 32 bit | signed | 2's complement int | -2^31 to 2^31-1 | 

long : 64 bit | signed | 2's complement | -2^63 to 2^63-1 |

float : 32 bit floating point | less memory than double | For precise values like currency use 'java,math.BigDecimal' class.

double : 64 bit floating point | 

char : 16 bit Unicode character | '\u0000' or '0' to '\uffff' or '65,535'

primitive types are not objects. 'new' keyword is not required.
